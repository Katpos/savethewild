    <p class="aboutme"> I love animals, from home pets to the huge animals from the wild.  Therefore, I want to protect them at all costs; Thereâ€™s a lot of animals on the brink of endangerment and extinction. I believe there should be reserves all over the world that would care for the animlas, keep them safe and maintain them. Hence, I created this website that allows us to communicate with other on such important matter.   </p>
